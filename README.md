### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Looking for an expert in modern LLMs?** I've got the experience you need. I'll guide you through every step,
fine-tuning everything from data collection to model training and improvement.

**Why me?** Well, with six years of experience in deep learning R&D projects, I've mastered a range of roles - from
leading a team to rolling up my sleeves as an engineer. I've built and improved products from scratch and I'm keen to do
the same for you.

**Worried about your team?** Don't be. With four years as a lecturer at Russiaâ€™s best university, I can equip them with
the skills they need to succeed.

**Want to know more?** Check

# About me

As a seasoned professional with over six years in Conversational AI, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, I excel in roles as a Machine Learning Engineer, Research Engineer, Team Lead and Mentor. 

I am intrigued by the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and looking for opportunities to utilise my talents in this area. Although I'm based in Armenia, I am globally mobile and prepared for remote work arrangements.

My achievements:
- Repeatedly achieved significant success in product development: increased customer satisfaction rates in open domain dialog system (from 20% to 75%), reduced translation costs for various B2B clients (from 15% to 45%), and improved machine translation quality (by up to 50%).
- Developed an open-domain dialog system that outperformed competitors under significantly limited resources, which was integrated into VK, reaching 86% of Russian users (101.7 million).
- Built various projects from scratch: machine translation quality estimation, automatic error correction in translation, 4 open domain and goal-oriented dialog assistants.
- Managed a total of 15 people in different companies (the largest team is 4 people).
- Trained, distil and deployed in production LLMs (7B, 13B, 30B) using novel approaches such as LoRA.
- Conducted a course that had been awarded for 4 consecutive years and graduated 4 cohorts of students (more than 80 people). Many of the students work in positions like Team Lead, Senior, PhD, Middle in leading technology companies and universities in Russia and beyond.
- Led and actively participated in student research. Master thesis projects: LLM Dialog Model Capable of Understanding and Sending Images (2023); Semantic Model Distillation (2020); Using Memory in Dialog Models (2023); Augmentation Methods NN Models (2020); Multi-domain Sentence Embeddings (2020).
- Pioneered the development of one of the first banking chatbots in Russia.
- Accomplished in developing solutions using the GPT-family API, including dataset generation using advanced methods.

Tools: Python, PyTorch, transformers, Docker, FastAPI, GCP, LLMs, ONNX, Triton Inference Server, unit tests, Git, MongoDB, Redis, Celery, Amplitude, Github Actions, Circle CI, Sentry, codecov, mypy, black, pre-commit hooks, faiss, Notion, Agile, Scrum, prompt engineering, CoT, data labeling and collecting using LLMs.
